# Real-Time-EV-Health-Monitoring-Dashboard

EV Health Monitoring Dashboard
A real-time Electric Vehicle (EV) health monitoring dashboard built with Python, MongoDB, and CustomTkinter. This project visualizes live sensor data from an EV system, helping users monitor key parameters like motor temperature, battery voltage, and tyre pressure through a modern GUI interface.

# **üîß Features**

Live Data Visualization
Fetches real-time data from MongoDB Atlas and displays it using Matplotlib.

Multiple Parameters Monitored

**Motor:** Temperature, Current, Voltage

**Tyre:** Pressure, Temperature

**Battery:** Temperature, Current, Voltage

**Dark Mode Interface**
Built using CustomTkinter for a clean, modern look.

**Tabbed Dashboard**
Organized views for Motor, Tyre, and Battery health.

**Dynamic Time Filter**
Allows users to select time windows (1, 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes) for viewing live trends.

**Interactive Controls**
Includes refresh and exit buttons for user control.
