# Real-Time-EV-Health-Monitoring-Dashboard

# EV Health Monitoring Dashboard
A real-time Electric Vehicle (EV) health monitoring system built using Python, Flask, MongoDB, and CustomTkinter. This project allows users to monitor live sensor data such as motor temperature, battery voltage, and tyre pressure via a modern desktop dashboard interface.

# **üîß Features**

Live Data Visualization
Fetches real-time sensor data from MongoDB Atlas and visualizes trends using Matplotlib.
Multiple Parameters Monitored

**Motor:** Temperature, Current, Voltage

**Tyre:** Pressure, Temperature

**Battery:** Temperature, Current, Voltage

**Dark Mode Interface**
Built using CustomTkinter for a clean, modern look.

**Tabbed Dashboard**
Organized views for Motor, Tyre, and Battery health.

**Dynamic Time Filter**
Allows users to select time windows (1, 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes) for viewing live trends.

**Interactive Controls**
Includes refresh and exit buttons for user control.
